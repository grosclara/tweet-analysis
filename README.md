The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of this project will consist in delivering a first version of the end-to-end analysis tool, i.e. from data collection to sentiment prediction and its visualization with simple solutions.

In particular, the MVP :
* Will allow to connect to the Twitter API to collect a set of tweets related to an entity.
* Will be based solely on the analysis of the textual content of the tweets and will neglect information about the author of the tweet, its type (retweet, reply, ...) and its multimedia content.
* Will allow simple processing and analysis of tweets.
* Display the results of the analysis in the form of a time graph as above.
